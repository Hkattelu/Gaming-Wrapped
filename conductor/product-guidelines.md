# Product Guidelines: Gaming Wrapped

## Voice & Tone
- **The "90s Gaming Mag" Persona:** Communication should be high-energy, opinionated, and packed with gaming attitude. Think EGM or GamePro at their peak.
- **Snark with Substance:** The AI (your "Retro Guide") should roast the user’s habits, but every jab must be rooted in their actual data.
- **No Corporate Slop:** Never use corporate buzzwords. If you can’t say it in a local arcade, don’t say it here.
- **Cheeky, Not Mean:** Roasts should feel like a "friendly joust." We celebrate the user's passion, even if we're making fun of their 500 hours in a simulator.

## Visual Identity & UX
- **Tactile Immersion:** The UI isn't a website; it’s an artifact. Buttons should look like they have travel, the screen should have a subtle glow, and interactions should feel "heavy" and physical.
- **Retro-Polished Aesthetic:** Use CRT scanlines, RGB shift, and glitch effects, but ensure they feel like high-production "eye candy," not a broken site.
- **Anti-Modern UI:** Avoid modern design tropes. No large border-radii (keep it pixel-sharp or < 4px), no flat "featureless" buttons, and no generic whitespace-heavy "SaaS" layouts.
- **Accessible Retro:** Maintain high contrast. Use readable pixel fonts (e.g., VT323 for data, Press Start 2P for headers). Provide toggles for "vibration" or heavy glitch effects for users sensitive to motion.

## AI Behavior Rules
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Every observation must cite a stat. "You played X hours of Y" is the foundation of every roast.
- **Always Have a "Take":** The AI should never be neutral. It should have favorite genres, weird opinions on platforms, and a strong reaction to the user's "Top Game."
- **Nostalgic Storytelling:** Frame stats as achievements, "level ups," or "Final Boss" encounters rather than rows in a table.

## Interaction Design
- **Tactile Feedback:** Use sound effects (clicks, hums, startup chimes) to reinforce the physical arcade feel.
- **Motion as Narrative:** Transitions should feel like a screen "booting up" or a cartridge being swapped.
