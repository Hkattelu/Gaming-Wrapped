# Initial Concept

Gaming Wrapped is a personalized year-in-review for your gaming habits. Upload your game data (e.g., from services like PlayTracker or custom CSVs), and our AI will generate a unique, shareable slideshow summarizing your gaming year, highlighting key stats, top games, platform preferences, and more.

# Product Definition: Gaming Wrapped

## Target Audience
- **Core Gamers:** Enthusiasts who meticulously track their libraries on platforms like Steam, Backloggd, or PlayTracker and want to see their data visualized.
- **Social Gamers:** Casual to mid-core players who enjoy "Wrapped" style content and want fun, high-fidelity graphics to share on social media.

## Core Goals
- **Nostalgic Celebration:** Celebrate a year of gaming through a high-production-value, interactive retrospective.
- **Data Discovery:** Use AI to analyze habits and provide meaningful (or humorous) insights and game recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Arcade Interface:** A unique "Arcade Cabinet" UI for navigating the slideshow with physical-style buttons and CRT effects.
- **AI Persona & Roasts:** A snarky, retro-themed AI voice (90s magazine style) that roasts user habits and assigns unique personas (e.g., "Backlog Baron").
- **Multi-Platform Analytics:** Deep dives into hardware usage, genre distribution, and score rankings via a "Hardware Laboratory."
- **Social Integration:** Optimized sharing templates for Instagram Stories, X, and direct URL sharing.
- **Flexible Data Entry:** Support for automated platform imports and manual CSV uploads.
