# Gaming Wrapped - Design Context

## Design Context

### Users
- **Primary Audience:** Gamers who want to visualize and share their annual gaming achievements and habits.
- **Context:** End-of-year review or on-demand retrospective. Users are likely sharing these results on social media (Twitter/X, Instagram, Discord).
- **Job to be Done:** Transform raw gaming data (CSV, API integrations) into a highly visual, shareable, and nostalgic narrative ("Wrapped") that celebrates their hobby.

### Brand Personality
- **Nostalgic:** Evokes the golden age of arcade and console gaming (8-bit, 16-bit, CRT era).
- **Playful:** Uses gaming tropes (achievements, boss battles, coin slots) to make data fun.
- **Technical but Accessible:** distinct retro-tech vibe (glitches, terminal code) without being unusable.
- **Three Words:** Retro, Tactile, Hype.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Theme:** "Arcade Cabinet" / "Retro Console" interface.
- **Visuals:** 
  - **CRT Effects:** Scanlines, RGB shift, screen curvature, glow.
  - **Typography:** Pixel fonts ('Press Start 2P' for headers, 'VT323' for data/terminals).
  - **Motion:** Glitch effects, pixelated transitions, "boot up" sequences.
  - **Decorations:** Physical arcade buttons, coin slots, screws, plastic textures on the frame.
- **Color Palette:** High-contrast neon accents (Hot Pink `oklch(0.586 0.222 17.555)`, Electric Yellow `oklch(0.860 0.173 91.838)`) against deep dark backgrounds (Charcoal/Black `oklch(0.141 0.004 285.824)`).

### Design Principles
1.  **Immersion First:** The UI should feel like a physical artifact (arcade cabinet) rather than a website. Sound effects and tactile interactions (clicking buttons) are crucial.
2.  **Data as Story:** Don't just show numbers; frame them as "High Scores," "Boss Battles," or "XP Gained."
3.  **Share-Ready:** Every card or slide must look good as a standalone image for social media sharing.
4.  **Retro Polished:** Use retro aesthetics but modern usability (Radix UI primitives, responsive layout). It should look old but feel new.
